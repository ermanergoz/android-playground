# jHealth

Programming language of choice: Kotlin

Android application for health management, where the application would provide the user with:

  •	Diet monitoring/suggestion including daily calorie intake and BMI level

  •	Sleep tracking

  •	Water intake tracking and reminder 

  •	Workout plan 

The user inputs personal data and can personalize it based on the needs. In case the user is taking daily/weekly medication, the application would be able to send the user reminders/notifications about it. Application would track the user’s progress and provide tips/guidelines/plans as well as weekly reports (charts, graphs) in order to help the user achieve the desired goals (ex. certain weight, change of sleeping pattern, water intake, etc).
